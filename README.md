# Bowery Chrome Extension Svelte

## Development
1. Check if your Node.js version is >= 6.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
4. Run `yarn`.
5. Change the package's name and description on `package.json`.
6. Change the name of your extension on `src/manifest.json`.
7. Run `npm run start`
8. Load your extension on Chrome following:
    1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
    2. Check `Developer mode`
    3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
    4. Select the `build` folder.
9. Have fun.

## Add to chrome
1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
2. Check `Developer mode` switch
3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
4. Select the folder containing extensions source.

## Structure
All your extension's development code must be placed in `src` folder, including the extension manifest.

The boilerplate is already prepared to have a popup, a options page and a background page. You can easily customize this.

Each page has its own assets package defined. So, to code on popup you must start your code on `src/js/popup.js`, for example.

Svelte components are under `src/svelte/*.svelte`. The example popup component is provided at `src/svelte/popup.svelte`. .svelte extension is used to distiguish components from static html files, required for an extension.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM
To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file o your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm start
```

## Packing
After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```
Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets
If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: "123" };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from "secrets";
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```
:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
